for now I'm unable to add loki check because my windows can't install new required updates.
I've spend a day but I can't fix it.
That is why for now I will skip loki test in CICD (github actions).

And using loki 0.32 and storybook gives an error which is unable to fix now...
That i why I downgraded their versions.
